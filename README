The programming language SQUIRREL 0.2 pre-alpha

This is a work in progress
--------------------------------------------------
the current development state is pre-alpha,
this mean that all features have been implemented but
they could be subject to changes.
The project has been compiled and run on Windows(Windows XP/2000 on Intel x86) and
Linux(Slackware 9.0 on Intel x86).

Has been tested with the following compilers:
	MS Visual C++ 6.0,7.0 and 7.1
	MinGW gcc 3.2 (mingw special 20020817-1)
	Linux gcc 3.2.3
	

Work in prograss
-The documentation is unfinished
-The API library will be extended and will be subject to minor changes
-the libraries (sqlibs) are just a prototype for testing pouposes;
	a system for dynamic library loading is under development.
-The stand alone version of the interpreter "sq" is still in early(messy) stage.
-The language core need extensive testing.
-The runtime erros messages are a bit weak :)
