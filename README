The programming language SQUIRREL 0.7 alpha

This is a work in progress
--------------------------------------------------
the current development state is alpha,
this mean that all features have been implemented.
The project has been compiled and run on Windows(Windows XP/2000 on Intel x86) and
Linux(Slackware 9.0 on Intel x86).

Has been tested with the following compilers:
	MS Visual C++ 6.0,7.0 and 7.1
	MinGW gcc 3.2 (mingw special 20020817-1)
	Cygnus gcc 3.2
	Linux gcc 3.2.3
	

Work in prograss
-The documentation covers all topics but has to be improved/corrected.
-The API library could be extended.
-the libraries (sqlibs) are just a prototype for testing pouposes;
	a system for dynamic library loading is under development.
-The language could have some minor bug.
